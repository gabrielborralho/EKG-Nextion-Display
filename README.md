# Nextion Editor
To carry out the design of the display, we used the nextion editor software that can be downloaded from the link below:
https://nextion.itead.cc/resources/download/nextion-editor/

The design of this project can be accessed at `EKG-Nextion-Display/Project-of-Nextion-Editor/ECG_Display.HMI`

# Processing IDE
The EKG reading can also be viewed on the computer through the Processing IDE software, which can be downloaded at:
https://processing.org/download/
The code for processing implemented in this project can be accessed in `EKG-Nextion-Display/EKG_PROCESSING/ECG_PROCESSING.pde`.
This is the result of a reading:
